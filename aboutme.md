My name is Marcelo Moreira and I am the IT Infrastructure Manager (Systems & Networks) for [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu)'s [LBRE](http://lbre.stanford.edu) Department.

If you're reading this, you're probably a friend whom I somehow managed to trick or coerced into giving me some page hits ;-)

# Software I Use and I Am Grateful For

Can't live without:

 * [Git](http://git-scm.com) - for version control
 * [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com) - OS of choice for pretty much everything
 * [Python](http://www.python.org) - great language: where has it been all these years ?!?!?! I started using it a few years ago. I just wish I have started sooner.

Could live without, but have to use:

 * [Redhat Linux](http://www.redhat.com) - use it at work because sometimes I just have to. Seriously, not a big fan...
 * [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) - some of the folks I work with are crazy for it.
