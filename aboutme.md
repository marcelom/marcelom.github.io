My name is Marcelo Moreira. I currently work as a Cloud DevOps Engineer for Sony Network Entertainment International, most specifically for Plaustation 4 Infrastructure.

If you're reading this, you're probably a friend whom I somehow managed to trick or coerced into giving me some page hits ;-)

# Software I Use and I Am Grateful For

Can't live without:

 * [Git](http://git-scm.com) - for version control
 * [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com) - OS of choice for pretty much everything
 * [Python](http://www.python.org) - great language: where has it been all these years ?!?!?! I started using it a few years ago. I just wish I have started sooner.
 * [Chef](http://www.getchef.com) -  I work on a Chef shop... Plus, I really like it as a configuration management platform. Although, it lacks a few orchestration features...
 * [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com) - in my opinion, the greatest configuration management & orchestration tool out there.

Could live without, but have to use:

 * [Redhat Linux](http://www.redhat.com) - use it at work because sometimes I just have to. Seriously, not a big fan...
 * [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) - some of the folks I work with are crazy for it.
