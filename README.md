# Marcelo's Personal Site

My personal website at http://marcelom.github.io/

----

This is the data for my personal blog.

It is automatically transformed by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) into a static site whenever I push code to this git repository.

Like many others, I dont like the idea of my blog posts ending up somewhere in a database... I want to be able to author the posts locally in Markdown (and possibly Textile), and have full control of the theme. It should also take care of the ATOM/RSS feed for me. And above all, it needs version control (GitHub) !
