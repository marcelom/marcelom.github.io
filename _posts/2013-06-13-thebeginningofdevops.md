Summary: The Beginning of DevOps (first out of three articles in the series)

It is no big secret that I have actively trying to implement a DevOps culture into the workplace.

Things change and the definitive way to stay successful is to embrace these changes, and change with it. That is how things have been done right under our very own eyes for millions of years (Evolution ?!).

Nevertheless, workplace culture moves at glacier speeds. Things are not as easy as it seems...

Then, a few months ago, i came across Mark Zuckerberg’s famous letter to shareholders in the eve of Facebook's IPO, entitled “The Hacker Way”. I was absolutely stunned. I leave you here with a few excerpts from it. I hope you enjoy it !

__The Hacker Way, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook__

__We hope to strengthen how people relate to each other.__
Even if our mission sounds big, it starts small - with the relationship between people.
Personal relationships are the fundamental unit of our society. Relationships are how we discover new ideas, understand our world and ultimately derive long-term happiness.

__We hope to improve how people connect to businesses and the economy.__
We think a more open and connected world will help create a stronger economy with more authentic businesses that build better products and services.

__Focus on Impact.__
If we want to have the biggest impact, the best way to do this is to make sure we always focus on solving the most important problems.

__Move Fast.__
Moving fast enables us to build more things and learn faster. However, as most companies grow, they slow down too much because they’re more afraid of making mistakes than they are of losing opportunities by moving too slowly. We have a saying: “Move fast and break things.” The idea is that if you never break anything, you’re probably not moving fast enough. Plus, you will end up breaking things anyways, fast or slow !

__Be Bold.__
Building great things means taking risks. This can be scary and prevents most companies from doing the bold things they should. However, in a world that’s changing so quickly, you’re guaranteed to fail if you don’t take any risks. We have another saying: “The riskiest thing is to take no risks.” We encourage everyone to make bold decisions, even if that means being wrong some of the time.

__Be Open.__
We believe that a more open world is a better world because people with more information can make better decisions and have a greater impact.
